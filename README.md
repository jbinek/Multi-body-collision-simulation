# Multi-body collisions simulation - multibody collisions in molecular dynamics

 
Main objective of this project was to simulate and visualize multi-body collisions in micro scale, it means in molecular dynamics. This project was also about a few scientific experiments on created simulation f.e. test of multi-body collisionsâ€™ behaviour with and without gravity within the environment.
